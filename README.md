A minimalistic reading challenge app to track your progress towards your reading goals.

1. Set a goal
2. Log the books you read
3. Share your progress

The app is being built with React Native, and I am also working on a web app with React.

*If you are interested in testing out the app; please send me an email: __jacob@jacobhcarlton.com__*
